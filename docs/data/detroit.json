Born in Detroit to middle-class parents, Goines rejected conventional paths, falsifying his age to join the Air Force at 15 and returning with a heroin addiction that would define his life. He cycled through Michigan's prison system seven times, teaching himself to write during his incarcerations. Between 1969 and 1974, Goines produced sixteen novels that sold millions of copies, primarily through informal distribution networks in Black communities. His work captured the texture of urban survival—the hustles, the addictions, the violence, the codes of honor among outlaws. On October 21, 1974, Goines and his partner Shirley Sailor were murdered in their Highland Park home, a crime that remains unsolved. Theories suggest his killers may have been figures from the life he documented, making his death the final chapter of the story he spent his career telling.",

Operating from a fortified farm outside the city where he trains his soldiers, Kenyatta wages a systematic war against the forces destroying his community. The series follows his escalating conflict with both the criminal underworld and law enforcement, culminating in a cross-country chase that ends in Las Vegas. Kenyatta represents Goines's vision of what organized Black resistance might look like—a disciplined, armed, community-authorized force operating outside the law to protect those the law refuses to serve.",

He traveled to Cuba in 1964 to study the Castro government. In 1965, Baker wrote an open letter refusing the Vietnam draft, declaring 'when the call is made to FREE 12TH STREET HERE IN DETROIT, when these calls are made, send for me, for these shall be Historical Struggles in which it shall be an honor to serve!' This was two years before Muhammad Ali's famous refusal. After working at Chrysler's Dodge Main plant, Baker led 4,000 workers in a wildcat strike on May 2, 1968, founding the Dodge Revolutionary Union Movement (DRUM). DRUM spawned the League of Revolutionary Black Workers in 1969, combining Black Power politics with labor organizing at the point of production. Baker remained a revolutionary organizer until his death on May 18, 2014.",
