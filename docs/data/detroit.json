Born in Detroit to middle-class parents, Goines rejected conventional paths, falsifying his age to join the Air Force at 15 and returning with a heroin addiction that would define his life. He cycled through Michigan's prison system seven times, teaching himself to write during his incarcerations. Between 1969 and 1974, Goines produced sixteen novels that sold millions of copies, primarily through informal distribution networks in Black communities. His work captured the texture of urban survival—the hustles, the addictions, the violence, the codes of honor among outlaws. On October 21, 1974, Goines and his partner Shirley Sailor were murdered in their Highland Park home, a crime that remains unsolved. Theories suggest his killers may have been figures from the life he documented, making his death the final chapter of the story he spent his career telling.",

Operating from a fortified farm outside the city where he trains his soldiers, Kenyatta wages a systematic war against the forces destroying his community. The series follows his escalating conflict with both the criminal underworld and law enforcement, culminating in a cross-country chase that ends in Las Vegas.

When Dellaplane Sr. begins systematically murdering union officials to consolidate political power, Jackson investigates—only to be framed for the murder of Dellaplane's wife. Going vigilante with the help of Sydney Ash, a nightclub singer Dellaplane has addicted to heroin, Jackson wages a one-man war against the industrial conspiracy. The character emerged from Carl Weathers's conversations with producer Joel Silver about their shared love of 1970s blaxploitation films, updating that tradition for Reagan-era action cinema.",

For nearly five decades, Scott remained on the front lines of Detroit's struggle for justice—from Panther organizing to police accountability advocacy to community peace-building. As spokesperson for the Detroit Coalition Against Police Brutality and founder of Peace Zones for Life, Scott evolved from revolutionary militant to 'Transformational Anthropologist,' as he called himself, dedicated to changing human behavior toward peace and reconciliation.

        "description": "General Gordon Baker Jr.—'General' was his given name—was born in Detroit to parents who had migrated from Georgia seeking auto industry work. After graduating from Southwestern High School at 16, Baker studied Marx at Wayne State University and co-founded UHURU, an African-American student organization, in 1963. He traveled to Cuba in 1964 to study the Castro government. In 1965, Baker wrote an open letter refusing the Vietnam draft, declaring 'when the call is made to FREE 12TH STREET HERE IN DETROIT, when these calls are made, send for me, for these shall be Historical Struggles in which it shall be an honor to serve!' This was two years before Muhammad Ali's famous refusal. After working at Chrysler's Dodge Main plant, Baker led 4,000 workers in a wildcat strike on May 2, 1968, founding the Dodge Revolutionary Union Movement (DRUM). DRUM spawned the League of Revolutionary Black Workers in 1969, combining Black Power politics with labor organizing at the point of production. Baker remained a revolutionary organizer until his death on May 18, 2014.",
